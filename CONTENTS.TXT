This is an overview of the examples ordered by chapter, section and subsection 
of appearance in the book.

Most of the examples are ports of the original C++ code examples. The examples with
a star (*) as postfix are written by myself to fill gaps.

For those marked as TODO, I haven't found a match yet.
